## Design
### Mood
The natural beauty found in nature provides me with a sense of amazement and a feeling of serenity.  Hence, I based my design inspiration from some the many breathtaking photos of marevellous landscapes that I had managed to find on pinterest.

In addition, I had a picture from a recent trip taken in Snowdonia, which I quite liked (despite it being not quite pinterest nor pro-photographer level)

In using these images as inspirations, I had to strike a fine balance between allowing the images overpowering my brand, versus completely losing the context of my inspiration. Eventually settling to use vector traces of the mountains and clouds as backgrounds for some of the page elements.

### Fonts
I mixed and matched a number of different combinations of serif & sans-serif fonts. In experimenting with the serif fonts, I noted that their regality tended to lose the 'serenity' of the 'mood' I wanted to convey.

I eventually decided on a sans-serif font - "Quicksand", with the intention Open Sans. On testing in a browser, Quicksand worked so well as a standalone font, (simply by shifting font-casing, weights and colors to denote headings and navigational elements). I thus decided to drop open sans from the font stack altogether, contributing to a more light-weight loading experience.



### Colors
In considering colour schemes, readability and good contrast was a high priority. I came across an article suggesting that [black text on a light background](http://www.allaboutvision.com/cvs/irritated.htm) provided good readability, and was easy on the eyes. 

With the colour palettes I experimented with, the base colours of a black-ish text (#B2B2B2) on a light background (#FFFFFF / #F2F2F2) remained a constant. I then experimented combining them with colours found within some of the the landscape photos.  

I was drawn to a particularly lovely shade olive-green, which in combination with my base colours, made for a lovely monochromatic color scheme.

### Inspiration
In searching for landscape pictures on pintrest, I was fortunate to have thumbnails of websites which had a similar feel to my mood appear on my feed. These images served as inspiration They showed how a subtle colour scheme could be used to great effect.

Some common themes of these layouts included their excellent use of whitespacing, and subtle notes of grey to break up sections. I sought to incooperate these simple, yet tasteful techniques into my design.

### Wireframe
I created my wireframes using figma. In prioritising the content and mobile views, I quickly realised the content I had drafted was far too verbose, and worked to summarize the information, and group them into categories which made sense.

Using figma, I was also able to trial a few diffferent ways of breaking up the content, before settling on my final iteration of the design.

### Usability Heuristics Considered
1. Visibility of system status
- Navigation bar is always visible, and within easy reach of the user
- Personal brand (my logo) is clearly visible upon loading the page, and is also constantly visible within the nav bar.
- Major sections of the site are clearly labelled
2. Match between system and the real world
- Standard sections that one can expect from a portfolio page (about, portfolio, resume, contact) are labelled with standard language 
3. User control and freedom
- Navigation bar anchored to the page allows user to skip to any section of the page
4. Consistency and Standards:
- Font color for headings & body text are been kept consistent throughout the site.
- Buttons employ a consistent look throughout the page
5. Error prevention
- Contact forms have input fields set to 'required', to prevent users from submitting blank fields. 
- Approriate input field types (e.g. 'email') also helps to validate data.
6. Recognition rather than recall
- Navigation links are labelled with text, as opposed to being left purely as a symbol, as it is well known that very few symbols have a shared universal meaning.
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
- I pruned extraneous detail from the main content, and made additional information accessible via a link to my full resume. In doing so, it was available for those who were interested, but did not interfere with the gist of the page.
