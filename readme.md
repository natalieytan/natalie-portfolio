## Design
### Mood
The natural beauty which can be found within the the world around, has never failed to provide me with a sense of amazement and a feeling of serenity. As such, I drew my design inspiration from photos of the marvellous landscapes that others (and myself) managed to capture.

After creating an initial mock-up of the design, I began to find that it lacked flavour

### Colors
In considering colour schemes, readability and good contrast was of high priority. Articles suggest that [black text on a light background](http://www.allaboutvision.com/cvs/irritated.htm) provides good readability, and is easy on the eyes. This concurs with my personal experience, that I tend to enjoy reading pages displaying black text on a white background.

In all the colour palettes I experimented with, off-black text (#B2B2B2) on a light background (#FFFFFF / #F2F2F2) remained a constant. With this base, , I then experimented with combinations of colours found within the landscape photos.  

There was a particularly lovely shade olive-green, from one of the photos of the mountains I had taken in Snowdonia. Using this shade in combination with my base colours, I eventually settled on on a monochromatic color scheme.

### Fonts
I mixed and matched, a number of different combinations of serif & sans-serif fonts. In experimenting with a number of serif fonts, I found that the regality of the serif fonts tended to lose the feel of the 'mood' I wanted to convey.

### Inspiration
In searching for landscape pictures on pintrest, I was fortunate to have thumbnails of websites which had a similar feel to my mood appear on my feed. These images served as inspiration They showed how a subtle colour scheme could be used to great effect. 

Some common themes of these layouts included their excellent use of whitespacing, and subtle notes of grey to break up sections. I sought to incooperate these simple, yet tasteful techniques into my design.

### Wireframe
Taking a content-and-mobile first approach, I created my wire-frames in figma. I was able to trial a few diffferent ways of breaking up the content, before settling on my final iteration.


### Usability Heuristics Considered
1. Visibility of system status
- Navigation bar is always visible, and within easy reach of the user
- Personal brand (my logo) is clearly visible upon loading the page, and is also constantly visible within the nav bar.
- Major sections of the site are clearly labelled
2. Match between system and the real world
- Standard sections that one can expect from a portfolio page (about, portfolio, resume, contact) are labelled with standard language 
3. User control and freedom
- Navigation bar allows user to skip to any section of the page
4. Consistency and Standards:
- Font color for headings & body text has been kept consistent throughout the site.
- Buttons employ a consistent look throughout the page
5. Error prevention
- Contact forms have input fields set to 'required', to prevent users from submitting blank fields. Approriate input field types (e.g. 'email') also helps to validate data.
6. Recognition rather than recall
- Navigation links are labelled with text, as opposed to being left purely as a logo, as it is well known that very few symbols have a shared universal meaning.
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
- In transferring content from my draft into my design, I had to prune a lot of extraneous detail from my 'about' blurb, as well as my employment & education history.
- I made additional information accessible via a link in my full resume, such that it was available for those who were intersted, but did not interfere much with the more relevant content.
